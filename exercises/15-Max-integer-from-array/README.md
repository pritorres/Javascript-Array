# `15` Max integer from the array 


## 📝Instructions:

1. Write a script that finds the biggest integer in `Myarray`.

2. Print that number in the console with the `console.log()` function.

### 💡 Hint:

- Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to 0.

- Then compare the variables with all the items in the list.

- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable.

- At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

### Expected result:

  5435
