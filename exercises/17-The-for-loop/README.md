# `17` The For Loop Find average

Another way to loop an array with the `for` loop will be using the `in` statement like this:

```js
for (var index in myArray){
    console.log(myArray[index]);
}
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Calculate the average value of all the items in the array 

2. Print it on the console.

### 💡 Hint:

To print the average, you have to add all the values and divide the result by the total length of the list.


### Expected result:

27278.8125
