# `06.4` Loop from the half to the end

This loop is not looping at all... because the variables `initialValue`, `stopValue` and `increasingValue` are equal to zero.

## üìù Instructions

1. Change the value of those variables to make the loop print only the last half of the array.

### :bulb: Hint:

Change nothing but the value of those 3 variables!

### Expected result:

```md
23
48
56432
55
23
25
12
```
